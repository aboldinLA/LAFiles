	If FileMaker is not working try quitting first and restarting.<br /><br />
    There several errors that can happen while using FileMaker. If the server is down you will not see or be able to connect to the database.<br />
    • I will usually know about this but you can send an IT request form to be safe.<br /><br />
    • If you get an error trying to get a word doc make sure that you are connect to the storage disk on the xserve.<br /><br />
    • If you get a connection error while trying to push or use a console, there are to many users, try again later.<br /><br />
    • If the system locks up you may have to force quite the program to restart it.<br /><br />
    • If you need to access certian data or fucnctions you will have to send in an IT request form so that privleges can be adjusted.<br /><br />
    • If you have lost data or find data missing or corrupted, you will need to send in an IT request form so it can be fixed.<br /><br />
    • You should always quit the FileMaker every night because of the backups that are run.
