Greg will examine ways to deal with the aftermath of fire, like erosion and weed control, and whether "restoration" is required or not. The success Greg has had with native landscape performance in fire has led the United States Navy to award his company a 5 year research grant that scientifically tests various methods of fuel modification, including thinning regimes and native garden design. Greg will share some preliminary results of the study so far.

		The session includes identifying the hot spots in cities using drones, at street and allotment levels; positioning trees in those areas to mitigate the heat island effect and deciding the desired target canopy area. It is important to start setting dates and tracking the progress. Gooden will introduce important guidelines when it comes to identifying canopy diameters in trees for desired shade cover and proper loam soil calculations.<br><br>
		The second thing that Gooden will discuss is WSUD or LID - water sensitive urban design, or low impact design. There are three main areas for integration of tree pits in water sensitive urban design: <br>
		1. Passive irrigation which is simply bringing water to a tree from hard pavement for the health of the tree. He will demonstrate some tools that they\'ve developed to model this. <br>
		2. Pollution removal. This is about the science behind the removal of pollutants out of stormwater and using software modelling to measure it. <br>
		3. Flood mitigation, or management of flows is the third area. Trees can be used for onsite retention to hold back water for the benefit of the trees root system to suck up and pump out for evapotranspiration and cooling over time. Incorporating capillary rise, and saturated zones for drought resilience, etc.<br><br>
		Last of all, Gooden will run through some photographs of the soils under pavement trial with Bartlett Tree Experts at their Arboretum in Charlotte, North Carolina.

A number of Greg Rubin's native landscapes have been involved in major fire events in San Diego county, without the loss of a single home, despite the sad loss of neighboring homes in many cases. It appears that a few basic considerations may actually help a native landscape become quite fire resistant. Greg will explore the factors that encourage successful, fire resistant native landscapes, including design, irrigation, and maintenance, and will share actual case histories from great fire events in San Diego county.<br><br>Discussion also includes proper thinning techniques for existing chaparral. Greg will examine ways to deal with the aftermath of fire, like erosion and weed control, and whether "restoration" is required or not. The success Greg has had with native landscape performance in fire has led the United States Navy to award his company a 5 year research grant that scientifically tests various methods of fuel modification, including thinning regimes and native garden design. Greg will share some preliminary results of the study so far. Although one could never guarantee that a native landscape will save a home in a fire event, experience has shown that contrary to popular opinion, a native landscape may actually be a sensible and environmentally responsible way to achieve defensible space around homes.`,

		The session includes identifying the hot spots in cities using drones, at street and allotment levels; positioning trees in those areas to mitigate the heat island effect and deciding the desired target canopy area. It is important to start setting dates and tracking the progress. Gooden will introduce important guidelines when it comes to identifying canopy diameters in trees for desired shade cover and proper loam soil calculations.<br><br>
		The second thing that Gooden will discuss is WSUD or LID - water sensitive urban design, or low impact design. There are three main areas for integration of tree pits in water sensitive urban design: <br>
		1. Passive irrigation which is simply bringing water to a tree from hard pavement for the health of the tree. He will demonstrate some tools that they've developed to model this. <br>
		2. Pollution removal. This is about the science behind the removal of pollutants out of stormwater and using software modelling to measure it. <br>
		3. Flood mitigation, or management of flows is the third area. Trees can be used for onsite retention to hold back water for the benefit of the trees root system to suck up and pump out for evapotranspiration and cooling over time. Incorporating capillary rise, and saturated zones for drought resilience, etc.<br><br>
		Last of all, Gooden will run through some photographs of the soils under pavement trial with Bartlett Tree Experts at their Arboretum in Charlotte, North Carolina. Six different tree planting methods were trialled - and the firm was invited to participate in this project. Some close-up photographs of the various systems and patterns of root growth in different types of growth media beneath pavement will be shown.`,
